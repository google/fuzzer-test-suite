# fuzzer-test-suite

:zap: **NOTE: For most use cases, fuzzer-test-suite is superseded by [FuzzBench](https://github.com/google/fuzzbench). 
We recommend using FuzzBench for all future fuzzer benchmarking. 
FuzzBench is based on many of the same ideas as FTS, such as realistic benchmarks (it actually uses some benchmarks from FTS) but has many improvements such as a free service and a design that makes adding new fuzzers and new benchmarks easier.**

This is a set of tests (benchmarks) for fuzzing engines (fuzzers).

The goal of this project is to have a set of fuzzing benchmarks derived from real-life
libraries that have interesting bugs, hard-to-find code paths, or other
challenges for bug finding tools.

In addition, this project provides a fuzzing engine
[comparison framework](engine-comparison/) to execute A/B tests between
different fuzzing configurations.

The current version supports [libFuzzer](http://libFuzzer.info) and
[AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).  In future versions we may support
other fuzzing engines.
