# fuzzer-test-suite

This is a set of tests (benchmarks) for fuzzing engines (fuzzers).

The goal of this project is to have a set of fuzzing benchmarks derived from real-life
libraries that have interesting bugs, hard-to-find code paths, or other
challenges for bug finding tools.

The current version supports [libFuzzer](http://libFuzzer.info),
in future versions we expect to support [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/)
and potentially other fuzzing engines.
